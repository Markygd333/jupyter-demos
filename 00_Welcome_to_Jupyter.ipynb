    "Welcome to this quick introduction to Jupyter Notebooks. Keep on reading if you want to find out **how to navigate and work with Jupyter Notebooks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ü§® What is this? \n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, a Jupyter Notebook is **just a file** - like a Word document or a PDF. It's a combination of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) text and **interactive code** (mostly Python, but also other code works.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like you need the program Microsoft Word to open a Word file, or a PDF reader to open a PDF file, you need a special program to open Jupyter Notebook files. The fact that you're reading this means that you already have a program like that open - usually it runs within the web browser. If you want to find out more you can check the [official website](https://jupyter.org/try).\n",
    "\n",
    "## üì∫ What is this interface?\n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, the interface can be a bit overwhelming. There are a lot of buttons and places to click. **Most can be ignored** for now as you really only need them once you start creating your own Jupyter Notebook files and working with multiple files at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the program you're using to view the notebook uses **JupyterLab**, you'll see on the left a list of files. That's where you can open, create, delete, and move around files like Jupyter Notebooks (but also other files.) At the top you have the  usual navigations for saving, downloading, editing files and more. The most space of the screen is taken up by the actual Notebook file. Most likely you only have to worry about that space for now and can ignore the rest. \n",

    "## üìù How to work with Jupyter Notebooks?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter Notebook is split into multiple **cells**. A cell is usually either a bit of **Markdown text** (like what you're reading right now) or a piece of **code**. You can **select cells** by clicking on them or using the arrow keys on your keyboard."
