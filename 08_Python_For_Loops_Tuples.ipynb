    "For the final part of this lesson, you're going to learn about another type of loop. You already learned about the `while` loop. The `for` loop is another way to repeat code multiple times. But instead of looping code based on a condition it repeats code based on items in a sequence (such as items in a list, or characters in a string).\n",
    "\n",
    "A for loop allows you to iterate over all the items in a list and execute code for each member of the list. This is used in a large number of applications. In web applications or mobile apps `for`-loops are used all the time to make lists more visually appealing and add visual elements such as bullet points, line breaks, or checkboxes to each of the list items. Run the code below to see an example:"

Change the `print()` statements around and play with the code to help you understand how it works. It's not an easy concept if you hear about it for the first time!\n",
    "\n",

This is useful when using `for`-loops because it gives you access to an item's index during each iteration. Since it's a pair of two elements (the index and the actual item value) you then need to define two variables in the `for`-loop. Again, you can name those two variables whatever you want. But to keep the code understandable it makes sense to just call the first one `index` (or `i` for short) and the second one a meaningful name of the individual list item.\n",

    "1. First, create a simple to-do list application (in its own Python file) with the following main features:\n",
    "  - The user can choose whether to add an item, remove an item (by its index), or exit the application.\n",
    "  - The user may perform any of the first two actions multiple times without exiting the program. \n",

    "2. New: Add a third option to the application. Let the user also choose to \"show\" the current list of tasks. \n",
    "3. When the user chooses to \"show\" the list, print each individual list item on its own line on the screen. At the start of each line write the **index** followed by a dot before displaying the actual task. It should end up looking like a numbered list (like this one you're reading right now).\n",
    "4. While computers start counting at 0, humans don't tend to do that. Add `1` to each of the displayed indexes in the loop. And when the user enters a number to delete let them enter the displayed number and **not** the index. You'll need to do some simple math operations in a couple of places to achieve this. "
