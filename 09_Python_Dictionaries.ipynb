    "In this lesson, you'll learn one of the most important complex data types of them all: dictionaries. You'll be able to represent the data of your application in complex data structures making it easy to reason about what kind of data an application needs and how it relates to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📖 Dictionaries\n",
    "([Back to top](#Table-of-Contents))\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like a **list**, a **dictionary** is another **complex data type** - which means it represents multiple data points at once (just like a list). In other programming languages, it's also known as **hash** or **object**. Although, you should be careful as both those terms can also mean slightly different things. Python likes to name things in a more human-understandable way. That's why a list is called a list (and not an \"array\"). If you think of a real-world dictionary you think of a book with lots of terms that are paired up with a definition or a translation. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a simplified dictionary might look like something like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python: \"a very large snake that kills animals for food by wrapping itself around them and crushing them\"\n",
    "software: \"the instructions that control what a computer does\"\n",
    "jupiter: \"the planet fifth in order of distance from the Sun, after Mars and before Saturn\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "[Source: Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/)\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary is filled with pairs of words and their definitions. Or in programming terms: It's filled with pairs of **keys** and **values**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Different kinds of data sets need different tools to represent them. Simple shopping lists or to-do lists are usually written from top to bottom in a simple list format. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries, on the other hand, are useful when you want to connect two pieces of information: A word and its definition, or an English word and its German equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "So much like their equivalents in the physical world, dictionaries and lists serve different purposes for different kinds of data. There are gray areas and complex combinations. But we'll get to those at the end of this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📝 Creating Dictionaries\n",

    "Imagine a simple phonebook app that lists multiple names and their corresponding phone number. You could try to store the data in a list of strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "contacts = [\n",
    "  \"Samantha 123-456-7890\",\n",
    "  \"Sammy 980-765-4321\",\n",
    "  \"Sam 321-654-0987\"\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But that has multiple downsides. You have the phone number and name both in the same string and first need to find a way to separate them if you want to call someone straight from the app. It's hard to search and sort the individual names. You may want to display the name and the number in separate places. \n",
    "\n",
    "It makes a lot more sense to create a **dictionary** in this situation."

People want to improve the language, make it more intuitive, more easy, or add new features to it. But how do you change a programming language without causing all existing software written in that programming language to break? You add to it without removing the old parts. \n",

    ">This is why many older programming langauges often have multiple different ways to do the same thing. So don't be surprised if you find different code examples writing Python code slightly differently from what you have learned so far. Like with `del` and `pop()` it's very likely that there are simply various alternatives to doing a similar (but maybe slightly different) thing."

Work with print statements to try getting close to the solution if you get stuck!)_\n",

But Python has a lot of powerful features that go way beyond the scope of any tutorial. So it's not a bad idea to get familiar with Python's own tutorials and documentation. Only once you have completed the task above and if you are looking for a more advanced task look at this official tutorial and try to apply what you have learned there to store the contact list as a simple .txt text file: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#"
